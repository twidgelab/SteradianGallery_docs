I still need to work this out ~~and set up issues tracking page~~


#### current version 0.1.1
:poultry_leg: Note on performance :poultry_leg: 

I have tested this on 2 computers, Newish Asus laptop with GTX 1070 and fps seems pretty solid there, however the 970 in my home desktop is playable but less reliable.  I will look into optimising further, but until then any lesser card is not recommended

This version is set only to play on HTC Vive, but I thimk it will work on the Rift with touch controllers, it will just show the Vive controller.  I will try to test this soon  

Unzip the file, and double click the 'SteradianGallery.exe'

To teleport: 
 * Pull and hold the trigger (thumb button also works)
 * Move the controller to aim at the intended destination
 * Let go to teleport

To quit, hit escape
____

* There is no other interaction at this time
* There is no audio at this time
