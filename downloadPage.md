#### current version 0.1.1
:poultry_leg: Note on performance :poultry_leg: 

I have tested this on 3 computers

* GTX 1080Ti in graphics workstation, no surprises this works like crazy
* GTX 1070 in laptop- Asus  GL502vs, fps seems pretty solid there
* GTX 970 in my home desktop is playable but often 45fps.  I will look into optimising further, but until then any lesser card is not recommended

This version has only been tested on HTC Vive, but I think it will work on the Rift with touch controllers (but will show the Vive controller).  I will try to test this soon and then update this page if changes are needed  

Unzip the file, and double click the 'SteradianGallery.exe'

To teleport: 
 * Pull and hold the trigger (thumb button also works)
 * Move the controller to aim at the intended destination
 * Let go to teleport

To quit, hit escape
