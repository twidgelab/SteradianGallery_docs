### The Steradian Gallery

This is UE4 Gallery project for VR.  

The concept is to create a completely plausable high end gallery space, within which someone can show sculpture, installations, paintings, and photography.  There are many potential applications for this, it can be used to show digital only artworks in a high art context, for prototyping physical builds, images for grant applications.  Hosted online this could present regular curated exhibits.
