I have regularly imagined if I had a gallery space and unlimited funds, what kind of work would I make.  

I thought if I had this very realistic 'art space' in VR, I could explore this and many other things:

* Prototype and experience ideas that would be cost prohibitive and time consuming to fabricate
* Evaluate scale or sound or many other aspects of work before any physical fabrication
* Share work to an audience without requiring physical proximity by distributing an experience of artworks through the Internet
* Curate group exhibitions of all digital artworks from artists all over the world
* Exhibit works that could never be fabricated, things with non-physical effects
* Create interactive experiences with artworks: imagine a mash-up of 'high end gallery' and Kingspray Graffiti Simulator, or something where user input is required for motion or other effects

To prove out the idea, I have this first iteration.  The space has three rooms.  In the 'front' room are a group of 9 photographs and one large figurative sculpture.  

In the center room, where I had imagined I could make room scale installations or projections, I have a room filling sculptural self portrait.  

In the back room are 3 more figurative sculptures.

The photographs are from a series I called 'The Black Toys' made in 2007.  I had been collecting small, hand sized, plastic toys from thrift stores.  I painted these black and photographed them in groups.  For many of the photos, I filled them with cement and sunk them in a fish tank to make an atmospheric drama for them to exist in.  These digital photos were never printed.

The sculpture is new and all made within the last 4 weeks.  For several, the subject is a commentary on 'VR'; the religious fanaticism that it often brings with it, the tactile deprivation that accompanies the current generation of technology, and the promise of social vr with it's 'almost connected' state of being.

Making these employed an array of digital content creation tools.  For the portrait, I used photogrammetry: Autodesks ReMake software, together with Wrap3 (a very nice piece of software specific to remeshing scan data).  For the other figurative works, these were made using a base mesh purchased online as a starting point.  This I rigged and posed in Maya taking advantage of motion capture data, also purchased online.  The 'patina' for all the works was created using Substance Painter.  All of these could use further refinement and could be considered work-in-progress.

The entire work exists in Unreal Engine 4.16
